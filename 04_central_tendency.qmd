## Objectives: {background-image="image/zach_bg.png" background-opacity=".3"}

-   Statistical models

-   Central Tendency

-   The 'fit' of the mean: variance

-   Dispersion

# üèÜSTATISTICAL MODEL

## From the Dead

-   Zach and Milton agree to help each other.

-   But Zach suspects that Milton and Pincus are responsible behind the disappearance of Alice.

-   Zach agreed to learn stats from Milton

## Why do we need statistical models?

-   Scientists try to make predictions about something in the real world ...

    -   it might be a psychological, societal, biological or economic process to which they do not have direct access.

-   Scientists cannot access the process directly ...

    -   they gather data and construct small-scale models of the process and use them to predict how these processes operate under more general conditions.

-   We want our small-scale model to resemble the real situation as closely as possible so that the predictions we make about the real world are accurate.

-   The statistical model we build must represent the data collected (the *observed data*) as closely as possible.

-   The degree to which a statistical model represents the data collected is called the **fit** of the model.

-   Architect or engineer will build a model that resembles the real one as closely as possible.

-   Once the model is ready, it can be used to estimate what would happen to the real building.

## Sample Size: bigger is better

-   Small sample size

-   Moderate sample size

-   Large sample size

## The one and only statistical model

-   "A statistical model is an equation that describes the phenomenon of interest"

-   $$
    outcome_i=(model)+error_i
    $$

-   Most statistical models are a variation on this one equation.

-   The model will change depending on what you are trying to achieve.

    -   Ultimately the word "model" is replaced with an equation that you believe summaries the pattern of data.

-   The price of reducing the raw data to a summary is that it will not perfectly reflect every entity in the sample

## The one and only statistical model

-   $$
    outcome_i=(model)+error_i
    $$

-   $$
    RAS_i=(model)+error_i
    $$

## The one and only statistical model

-   Statistical models usually, but not always, contain variables and parameters.

    -   Parameters are (usually) constant values believed to represent some fundamental truth about the relations between variables in the models.

    -   Unlike variables, which are measured, parameters are estimated from the data.

## Simplest possible model

-   $$
    outcome_i=(b_0)+error_i
    $$

-   Confuscious üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

    -   mean = $\bar{X}$

    -   correlation = $r$ (Greek symbol rho, $\rho$)

    -   linear model = $b$ (Greek symbol beta, $\beta$)

-   $b_0$ means we are predicting the outcome from zero other variables, that is, just from a single parameter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   $$
    outcome_i=(b_0+b_1Xi)+error_i
    $$

-   A lot of time it is more interesting to see whether we can summarize an outcome variable by predicting from scores on another variable.

-   We usually denote predictor variables with the letter $X$.

    -   $i$ = particular entity

    -   $outcome_i$ = outcome value for that particular entity

    -   $X_i$ = score on the predictor variable

    -   $b_1$ = predictor variable has a parameter attached to it which tells use something about the relationship between the predictor ($X_i$) and outcome

    -   $b_0$ = is still there to tell us the overall levels of the outcome if the predictor variable was not in the model

## RAS Statistical Model

-   $outcome_i=(b_0+b_1Xi)+error_i$

-   $relationship\;satisfaction_i=(b_0+b_1length_i)+error_i$

-   $outcome_i=(b_0+b_1X_{1i}+b_2X_{2i})+error_i$

-   $relationship\;satisfaction_i=(b_0+b_1length_i+b_2effort_i)+error_i$

-   "We use the sample data to estimate the value of the model parameters." $b$

-   "We use the sample data to *estimate* what the population parameters are likely to be"

# CENTRAL TENDENCY

## Alices' Relationship Assessment Scores![](image/alice_ras.png)

## Alices' Relationship Assessment Scores

-   32, 30, 28, 30, 29, 31, 29, 31, 11

-   A score that is very different from others is called an **outlier**.

-   Simplest model tries to summarize data in terms of a single parameter.

-   A popular choice would be a parameter that measures **central tendency**: a value that indicates the central point of a distribution of scores.

## The Mode

-   the score that occurs most frequently.

-   The tallest bar in the histogram and in the grouped frequency table, the score with the highest frequency.

## ü§ØYour Turn

-   Create a frequency distribution of Alice's RAS scores.

-   ![](image/ras_table.png)

## Downside of Mode

-   It will always be a value that actually occurs in the data.

-   But there could be two modes

-   Bimodal: a distribution with two modes

-   Multimodal: Data sets with more than two modes

-   if the frequencies of certain scores are very similar, then the mode can be influenced by only a small number of cases

## The Median
