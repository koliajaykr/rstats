## The Method of Least Squares

![](image/method-least-squares.png){fig-align="center"}

## The Method of Least Squares

-   It is a way of calculating the value of a parameter such that you get the value that produces the least squared error.

-   The equation of the mean works on this principle - it produces the value that produces the smallest sum of squared errors.

## The Method of Least Squares

-   Values of parameters other than the mean using different equations but common is they have the smallest sum of squared error.

-   Least error is no guarantee of the parameter estimate being accurate or representative of the population.

-   **How well our estimates represent the population? ðŸ¤”**

# HOW WELL DOES A SAMPLE REPRESENT THE POPULATION?

## Sampling Distribution

-   Sampling variation

    -   The extent to which a static (the mean, median, *F*, *t*, etc.) varies in samples taken from the same population.

-   We want to know how representative the estimate in our particular sample is likely to be of the true value in the population.

## Sampling Distribution

-   Sampling error

    -   The difference between the value of a population *parameter*, and the value estimated from the *sample*.

## Sampling Distribution

![](image/stand-error.png){fig-align="center"}

## Sampling Distribution

-   Some samples underestimate the population mean

    -   because they contained people who did less well on the test or who were at the lower extreme of population scores.

## Sampling Distribution

-   Some sample overestimate it

    -   because they contained people who did better on the test or fall at the upper extreme of population scores

## Sampling Distribution

-   Some samples are spot on.

-   A histogram shows us how many times each score occurs.

## Sampling Distribution

-   What do you notice about the distribution - what does it look like and what value is at the middle?

    -   Distribution is normally distributed

    -   Distribution is like a bell shape

    -   Population value is at the center

## Sampling Distribution

-   **Sampling distribution** is the frequency distribution of sample statistics (i.e., the mean or whatever parameter you are trying to estimate) from the same population.

## Sampling Distribution

-   We do not collect a lot of different samples. Instead we assume that the sample we have collected comes from the sampling distribution.

-   We can never access or make or see a real sampling distribution. It is like a girifinsect or unicorn.

-   **We can use the sampling distribution to tell us how representative a sample is of the population.**

## The Standard Error

![](image/standard-error.png){fig-align="center"}

## The Standard Error

"The standard deviation of a sampling distribution is called standard error"

-   When the parameter you want to estimate is the mean, then we are looking for the standard deviation of sample means, which is known as the **standard error of the mean**.

## The Standard Error

-   The standard error tells us how widely sample statistics are spread around the population value.

-   It tells whether estimates from samples are typically representative of the population value.

## How to calculate standard error?

-   Sampling distribution is an unicorn

-   Standard error of mean: $\sigma_{\bar{X}}=\frac{s}{\sqrt{N}}$

-   This equation will work only when sample size is fairly large why because...

    -   SE should be computed by dividing the ***population*** standard deviation ($\sigma$), for large samples using the ***sample*** standard deviation is a reasonable approximation.

## How to calculate standard error?

-   Fairly large sample is 30

-   If less than 30, then shape of the distribution will not be normally distributed and the distribution will be $t$-distribution.

-   Why sample size matters we need to under the **central limit theorem**?

## The Central Limit Theorem

![](image/central-limit.png){fig-align="center"}

## The Central Limit Theorem

-   With samples of 100 scores

    -   sample means varied between about 47 to 55

-   With samples of 30 scores

    -   sample means varied between about 45 to 60

-   With samples of 5 scores

    -   sample means varied between about 40 to 70

## The Central Limit Theorem

1.  Bigger samples are better because they give you a more precise (i.e., less variable) estimate of the population value

2.  As the sample sizes got bigger the sampling distributions became more normal ... despite the fact that the population of scores was very non-normal indeed.

## The Central Limit Theorem

**The central limit theorem is: regardless of the shape of the population, estimates in samples of parameters from that population will have a normal distribution provided the samples are "big enough".**

## So Far...

-   We measure statistic value from the sample to estimate the parameter value of the population

-   These estimates will vary from sample to sample and standard error gives us an idea of the extent to which they do.

-   Large standard errors suggest that sample estimates will vary a lot across samples (low **precision**).

-   Small standard errors suggest that different samples will yield relatively similar estimates (high precision).

-   When we use a single value from the sample to estimate a population parameter, it is known as a point estimate.

# CONFIDENCE INTERVALS

## Confidence Intervals

-   Point estimates (single value to estimate effect in population) and interval estimates (a range of values that contain the population value)

-   Confidence intervals are computed using the standard error.

## Confidence Intervals

if population mean is 50

![](image/conf-interval.png){fig-align="center"}

## Confidence Intervals

![](image/conf-interval-100.png){fig-align="center"}

## Confidence Intervals

1.  The sample means are different from the true mean

2.  Most of the intervals do contain the true mean, a few do not.

3.  The crucial thing is to construct the intervals such that they they us something useful.

    -   95% confidence intervals and sometimes 99% confidence intervals

## Calculating Confidence Intervals

-   We use standard error

    -   Standard error is small = sample estimates are around the true population value.

    -   Standard error is large = different samples produce very different estimates, spread more widely around the true population value.

## Calculating Confidence Intervals

-   We use normal distribution

## Calculating Confidence Intervals

![](image/conf-interval-anat.png){fig-align="center"}

-   lower boundary of confidence interval = estimate $-(1.96\times\;SE)$

-   upper boundary of confidence interval = estimate $+(1.96\times\;SE)$

## Calculating Confidence Intervals

$$
z=\frac{X-\bar{X}}{s}
$$

$$
z=\frac{X-\bar{X}}{SE}
$$

## Your Turn {background-color="#34568B"}

If the mean (estimate) in a sample of people taking the statistics test was 45 and the standard error was 5, what would the 95% confidence interval be?
