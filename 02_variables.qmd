# ðŸ“„ Writing Up Research

## The Language of Science

![](image/alicepaper.png){fig-align="center"}

## The Language of Science

-   **Why?**: the reason why they did the research

-   **How?**: how they did it

-   **What?**: what they found

-   **Who care?**: and what it means.

## Research Paper Format ...

-   **Abstract:** this is a summary of the whole study.

-   **Introduction:** the history lesson.

    -   start with the general background of the research and then describe specific studies;

    -   finish by saying what their hypotheses are.

## Research Paper Format ...

-   **Method:** There is enough detail that someone else could repeat the research, but not so much detail that they die of boredom reading it.

    -   information about participants, measures/materials, apparatus, design, procedure, scoring.

-   **Results**: this is where mystery is revealed: what did they find?

## Research Paper Format

-   **Discussion**: summarizing the results, means for their theory, means for the real world, limitations, what still needs to be done.

-   **References:** you can't write stuff in science without justifying it, names of the authors and the year that the research was published.

# ðŸ§® Maths And Statistical Notation

## Simple Maths

$$
1 + 2\times3^2
$$

## Remember BODMAS

-   Brackets

-   Order

-   Divide

-   Multiplication

-   Add

-   Subtraction

## What's the answer to this?

$$
10 + \frac{2(3+1)^2}{8} - 5
$$

## Let's understand this

### $$\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$$

## Let's understand this

### $$\sum_{i=1}^n x_i=10+6=16$$

## Let's try this

### $$\sum_{i=1}^n x^2_i$$

## Let's try this

### $$\sum_{i=1}^n x^2_i = 10^2 + 6^2 = 100+36 = 136$$

## Let's try this

### $$\left( \sum_{i=1}^nx_i \right)^2$$

## Let's try this

### $$\left( \sum_{i=1}^nx_i \right)^2=(10+6)^2=16^2=256$$

## Your Turn

#### $$y_i=\frac{\sum_1^nx_{chameleon}}{\left( \sum_1^nx_{human} \right)^2}$$

| Chameleon | Human |
|-----------|-------|
| 3         | 2     |
| 1         | 3     |
| 2         | 5     |
| 4         | 7     |
| 2         | 3     |

```{r}
library(countdown)
countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, top = 0, font_size = "2em", size = 0.5 )
```

## Your Turn: ANSWER

### $y_i=\frac{12}{400}=0.03$

# ðŸŽ¡Variables and Measurement

## Qualitative and Quantitative Data

"To test hypotheses you need to measure variables"

Two different approaches to testing hypotheses:

-   **Qualitative research:** "to gain support for a theory from what people say or write"

-   **Quantitative research:** "measure variables using numbers and then to use statistical methods to analyse these numbers to test your theory."

## **Qualitative Research**:

-   "to gain support for a theory from what people say or write"

    -   an individual interview or a group discussion would be transcribed

    -   topics or themes are identified

    -   analysis itself is based on writing an account of the themes you have identified

## Variables

-   "variables are just things that can vary, or have different values"

    -   some variables can be directly observed (height, weight or age) ...

    -   some variables you cannot measure directly (depression, anxiety, life satisfaction, relationship satisfaction)

## Construct

-   Something that cannot be directly measured is known as **construct**.

    -   To measure these constructs you need an **operational definition** of the construct.

    -   Operational definition is a procedure (or set of procedures) for quantifying it.

    -   For example Relationship Assessment Scale, caste discrimination, service quality etc. .

## Relationship Assessment Score

::: callout-note
## ðŸ˜ºMessage from Milton

reverse phrasing items need to be reverse-scored by subtracting the score given from the sum of the maximum and minimum possible responses.

## Levels of Measurement

![](image/scale.png){fig-align="center" width="8.19in"}

## Levels/Scales of Measurement

-   "the relationship between what is being measured and the numbers that represent what is being measured is known as the level of measurement."

    -   Nominal scale

    -   Ordinal scale

    -   Interval scale

    -   Ratio scale

## **Nominal Scale**

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Variables on the nominal scale are **categorical variables**, which are variables made up of categories.

-   **Coding** means when numbers are used to denote categories.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](image/scale.png)
:::
:::

## **Ordinal Scale**

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   categories that have a logical order
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](image/scale.png)
:::
:::

## **Interval Scale**

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   these are ordered categories, but also require that intervals between categories are equal.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](image/scale.png)
:::
:::

## **Ratio Scale**

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   these are ordered categories, but also require that intervals between categories are equal ... must also have a meaningful zero point.

-   Zero means a complete absence of the construct being measured.

::: callout-note
## ðŸ˜ºMessage from Milton

"The line between discrete and continuous variables can be blurred, though."
:::

## Measurement Error

-   "Ideally we want our measure to be calibrated such that values have the same meaning over time and across situations."

-   "There will often be discrepancy between the numbers we use to **represent** the thing we're measuring and the **actual value** of the thing we're measuring (i.e., the value we would get if we could measure it directly). This discrepancy is known as measurement error. Like self-report questionnaire.

## Validity and Reliability

ways to keep measurement error low

-   **Validity**: whether an instrument measures what is sets out to measure

-   **Reliability**: whether an instrument can be interpreted consistently across different situations.

::: callout-note
## ATTENTION

-   "To be valid the measure must first be reliable."
:::

## Face Validity

-   whether the items seem to relate to the construct that they measure

-   "the questions *do* seem to ask about relationships."

![](image/ras.png){fig-align="center" width="488"}

## Criterion Validity

-   compare scores on the measure to objective criteria - ideally real-world observations

![](image/ras.png){fig-align="center" width="488"}

## Content Validity

-   whether the individual items represent the construct being measured, and cover the full range of the construct.

-   we can ask whether those seven items cover all aspects of "relationship satisfaction" and whether each individual items relates to relationship satisfaction.

-   lack of breadth

![](image/ras.png){fig-align="center" width="488"}

## Test-retest Reliability

"to test the same people twice: a reliable instrument should produce similar scores at both points in time. ... However, it is complicated. ... Maybe your **new friend Milton** can help!
