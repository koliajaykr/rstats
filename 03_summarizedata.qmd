**Frequency Distribution**

-   **Frequency:** how many times each score occurs

-   If you add up the frequencies $(\sum{f})$, you get the sample size $(N)$.

-   We should mention the category even if the frequency is zero.

## üôÑHow does this help me to understand whether women are attracted to guys with high salaries?

-   Relative Frequency: how often a response is observed relative to the total number of responses.

## Relative Frequency

$$
relative\;frequency = \frac{frequency\;of\;response}{total\;number\;of\;responses}\\ = \frac{f}{N}$$

![](image/freq_dist.png){fig-align="center"}

## Relative Frequency

$$relative\;frequency=\frac{frequency\;of\;a\;rating\;of\;10}{total\;number\;of\;responses}\\ = \frac{2}{10}=0.1$$

## Relative Frequency

::: callout-note
## üò∫Message from Milton

-   Relative frequencies are proportions. Value from 0 to 1.

-   Decimals are quite unpleasant and students hate them.

-   Convert relative frequencies as percentages

    -   $0.1\times100=10\%$ (10% of people gave this response)

    -   $0.05\times100=5\%$ (5% of people gave this response)

-   5% of women rated a high salary's importance at 8 out of 10.

## Alice RAS score was 32

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Total 7 questions

-   Range of scores from 7 (someone circles 1 for all seven questions) to 35 (someone circles 5 for every question).
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](image/ras.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

-   Imagine RAS score of 20 similar age group women are: 16, 23, 26, 22, 14, 20, 8, 19, 22, 25, 17, 26, 27, 11, 32, 17, 20, 17, 14, 28.

## Grouped Frequency Distribution

"a frequency distribution where we group scores together."

![](image/group_freq_dist.png)

## Class Interval

We divide the scale of measurement into equal parts, each one known as **class interval**.

![](image/class_interval.png){fig-align="center"}

## Class Interval Width

The quantity of numbers in a class interval.

![](image/class_interval_width.png){fig-align="center"}

## Number of Intervals

Normally, no fewer than 5 intervals, and no more than about 15; so approximately **10 intervals is reasonable**.

![](image/intervals.png){fig-align="center"}

## A Good Class Interval

-   Intervals 5-7 and 7-9 ‚ùå

-   Intervals 5-7 and 9-10 ‚ùå

-   Intervals 5-7 and 8-10 ‚úÖ

-   Interval width should be 2, 5, 10 or multiple of 2, 5, or 10.

## Grouped Frequency Distribution

$$interval\;width=\frac{range\;of\;scores}{number\;of\;intervals}\\=\frac{highest\;score-lowest\;score}{number\;of\;intervals}$$

## Graphical Frequency Distributions

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Often it is more appealing to display frequency distributions as a **graph** (also known as **chart**).
-   Visually this can give you a very immediate impression of how scores in your data are distributed.

## Graphical Frequency Distributions

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Graphs come in lots of different shapes and sizes

-   They have a horizontal and vertical line known as the ***axes***.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](image/histo_ras.png){fig-align="center"}

## Graphical Frequency Distributions

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
The horizontal line usually displays a predicator variable, or an independent variable, usually denoted with the letter *x* it is known as ***x-axis**, or **abscissa**.*

## Graphical Frequency Distributions

::: columns

The vertical line usually displays an outcome variable, or a dependent variable, usually denoted with the letter *y* it is known as the ***y-axis***, or **ordinate**.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](image/histo_ras.png){fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If scale of measurement is interval or ratio, you can use a **histogram** and **frequency polygon** to display the frequency of scores.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

**Histogram** plots the frequencies as bars rising up from the x-axis.

![](image/histo_ras.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

**Polygon plots** them as points that are connected by straight lines.

![](image/poly_ras.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Graphs (charts) make it easier to spot the patterns of the data.

-   We can use patterns in the data to draw conclusions beyond those data.

-   **Why does the x-axis go up to the 11 when the response scale stopped at 10?**

## Idealized Distributions

-   The beauty of data is that we can use samples to estimate the shape of the distribution of scores in the entire population

-   Relative frequency of responses

-   It is reasonable to assume that the relative frequencies in the sample will be similar to those in the population.

-   We do not need to now the actual frequencies in the population, we work instead with relative frequencies.

## Relative Frequency/Density

-   Once we know the relative frequencies ... a smooth curve that shows an idealized relationship between the variable we measured and the relative frequency of responses.

-   The curve represents the relative changes from one score to the next.

-   This curve shows **density**, which is the probability of a given score occurring.

-   The resulting curve is known as a **probability distribution** with same defnition as a **probability density function.**

## Histograms for Nominal & Ordinal Data

![](image/barplot.png)

## Histograms for Nominal & Ordinal Data

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   It is a sort of a histogram

-   same information as a histogram - the frequency within categories - but these categories do not make up an interval or ratio scale of measurement.

## Histograms for Nominal & Ordinal Data

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   When we display information about a nominal or ordinal variable, it is called a **bar graph**.

-   There are spaces between the bars to indicate that they are independent categories and not point along an interval or ratio scale.

## Shape of the Distribution

-   You will find that certain shapes of distributions are common in the world ... we can describe certain distributions that are common to lots of different variables.

-   These "common" distributions have names such as the **normal distribution**, *t*-distribution, chi-square distribution, uniform distribution, binomial distribution and *F*-distribution.

-   These idealized distributions have a specific shape that can be described by an equation

## Shape of the Distribution

-   Ignore equation, focus upon the properties:

    -   Centre of the distribution (known as the **central tendency**).

    -   and the width or spread of the distribution (known as the **variability**).

## Normal Distribution![](image/normal_distribution.png)

## Normal Distribution

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   It looks like a bell, commonly called as a bell-shaped curve.

-   Majority of the scores lie around the centre of the distribution (so the largest bars on the histogram are all around the central value).
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](image/normal_distribution.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## Normal Distribution

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   The further we move away from the centre, the smaller the bars get, telling us that the more that scores deviate from the centre more unlikely, or infrequent, they are.

-   Many naturally occurring things have this shape of distribution.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](image/normal_distribution.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

## A distribution can deviate from normal

-   the curve is **symmetrical:** if we draw a vertical line through the centre of the distribution then it looks the same on both sides.

-   not all distributions are like that: some have **skew**.

![](image/skew.png){fig-align="center"}

## Positively Skewed

the frequent scores are clustered at the lower end and the tail points towards the higher or more positive scores

![](image/skew_positive.png){fig-align="center"}

## Negatively Skewed

the frequent scores are clustered at the higher end and the tail points towards the lower or more negative scores.

![](image/skew_negative.png){fig-align="center"}

## Kurtosis

the second way in which distributions can be non-normal is in whether there are too many or too few scores in the ends of the distribution (the *tails* of the distribution)

![](image/kurtosis.png){fig-align="center"}

## **Positive kurtosis** known as **Leptokurtic.**

distributions can tend to look pointy

![](image/kurtosis.png){fig-align="center"}

## **Negative kurtosis** known as **Platykurtic**.

tend to look flatter than normal

![](image/kurtosis.png){fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   There are lots of other things that affect how pointy or flat a distribution looks.

-   In a normal distribution the values of skew and kurtosis are 0 (i.e., the shape of the distribution is as it should be).

-   If a distribution has values of skew or kurtosis above or below 0 then this indicates a deviation from normal.
