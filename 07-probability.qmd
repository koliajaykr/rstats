## Probability Theory

![](image/phone-friends.png){fig-align="center"}

## *Friends*

-   Imagine you have total five friends

-   Select one of these friends. Each selection is known as experiment.

-   **Experiment** "refers to any procedure that can be repeated and that has a well-defined **outcome** or set of outcomes."

-   The complete set of possible outcomes is known as the **sample space**.

-   A particular instance of the experiment is known as a **trial.**

## ***Friends***

-   **Random sample:** "means that each of the five contacts in your phone has an equal chance of being selected"

    -   **Sampling with replacement**: the name that has been selected or "sampled" is replaced back into the sample space.

    -   **Sampling without replacement:** once an item is selected or "sampled" it is not put back into the sample space and it cannot be selected on a subsequent trial.

## *Friends*

-   **Events**: An event is an outcome or set of outcomes of an experiment, and it is something to which we can assign a probability

-   An event can be any outcome that interests you.

    -   Single outcome, selecting Joel

    -   A set of outcomes, selecting a woman, man with glasses, no hair, dark hair.

## Classical Probability

In classical probability, if we assume that every outcome is equally likely then the probability of an event is the frequency with which that event occurs divided by the total number of possible outcomes (the sample space).

$$
P(x)=\frac{frequency(x)}{sample\;space}=\frac{f(x)}{sample\;space}
$$

## *Selecting Joel* is your Event

$$
P(Joel)=\frac{f(Joel)}{sample\;space}=\frac{1}{5}=0.2
$$

-   A probability value is a proportion, convert them into percentages by multiplying them by 100.

## Probability Interpretation

-   Probability as a scale that ranges from 0 to 1.

-   A probability of 0 means that an event is ***impossible***, and

-   A probability of 1 means that an event is ***certain***

-   A probability of 0.5 means that an event is just as likely to happen as it is to not happen.

## Probability Interpretation

-   A probability between 0.5 to 1 means that an event is more ***likely*** to happen than not, and the closer to 1 it gets, the more likely it is to happen.

-   A probability between 0 and 0.5 means that an event is more ***unlikel***y to happen than to happen, and the closer to 0 it gets, the less likely it is to happen.

## *Selecting a Woman* is your Event

$$
P(woman)=\frac{f(woman)}{sample\;space}=\frac{2}{5}=0.4
$$

## YOUR TURN ðŸ§  {background-color="#FFFACD"}

### What would be the probability of

1.  selecting a male

2.  selecting a bald person

3.  selecting someone with glasses

## **Bernoulli Trail**

-   An experiment or trial that has only two outcomes is known as a Bernoulli trail.
-   It assumes that each outcome is equally likely.

## Classical Probability

-   The classical probability of an outcome is the theoretical frequency of that outcome divided by the total number of possible outcomes (the sample space).

-   $$
    P(x)=\frac{frequency(x)}{sample\;space}=\frac{f(x)}{sample\;space}
    $$

## Empirical Probability

-   The empirical probability of an outcome is the observed frequency of that outcome divided by the total number of observed outcomes (the sample space).

-   It is same as the relative frequency.

-   $$
    relative\;frequency=\frac{frequency\;of\;outcome}{total\;number\;of\;outcomes}=\frac{f}{N}
    $$

## Empirical Probability

![](image/emp-probability.png){fig-align="center"}

## Empirical Probability

$$
empirical\;p(x)=\frac{frequency(x)}{sample\;space}=\frac{f}{N}
$$

## Probability

-   Probability values vary from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain), with 0.5 meaning that an event is as likely to happen as it is not to happen. They cannot be negative.

-   Probabilities are proportions, and so can be multiplied by 100 and expressed as percentages:

    -   0% = impossible to occur,

    -   50% = as likely to occur as not,

    -   100% = certain to occur.

## Frequency Distributions

-   They tell us about probability.

![](image/freq-distributions.png){fig-align="center"}

## Frequency Distributions

What is the probability of someone scoring 22?

![](image/freq-distributions.png){fig-align="center"}

## Frequency Distributions

What if I wanted to know the probability that a score was higher than 22?

![](image/freq-distributions.png){fig-align="center"}

## ðŸ’¡ The key thing is that this demonstrates that the area of any histogram represents probability.

## Put Histogram in Hat

Cut histogram in 100 squares & place in a hat

-   Probability of 21 green squares.

    -   Probability that the score is higher than the 22.

-   Probability of 1 red square.

    -   Probability that one 22 score.

-   Probability of 78 blue squares.

    -    Probability that the score is lower than 22.

-   ***What if there are not 100 squares?*** **ðŸ¤”**

## Probability Density Functions:

#### Idealized Versions of Histograms using whole scores and potential scores

![](image/ideal-histogram.png){fig-align="center"}

## Probability Density Functions

The area under the curve represents probability which is equal to 1 or the probability of all scores summed together is 1.

## Probability and the Normal Distribution

-   Standard Normal Distribution has mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

-   If we think that the distribution is normal then we can convert any distribution of raw scores into $z$-scores.

## Areas under Standard Normal Distribution

-   Normal Distribution

-   Probability density function

-   Standard Normal Distribution

-   Area under it equal a probability of 1

-   We can start to think about how different areas translate into different probabilities.
